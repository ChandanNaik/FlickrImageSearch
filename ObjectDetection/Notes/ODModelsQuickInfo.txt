Datasets use to generate the pretrained model:
 PASCAL Visual Object Classification (PASCAL VOC) :contains only 20 categories
 ImageNet: 500000 images only for training and 200 categories
 Common Objects in COntext (COCO) : contains 80 categories, 120 000 images for training,more than 40 000 images for testing
 
Techniques use:
 Region-based Convolutional Network (R-CNN)
 Fast Region-based Convolutional Network (Fast R-CNN)
 Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN)
 Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN)
 You Only Look Once (YOLO)
 Single-Shot Detector (SSD)
 YOLO9000 [This is the one we want, but we are using ResNet now]
